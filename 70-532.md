## Cert Path
   The certification path is for the MCSA: Cloud Platform and passing this MTA with one of the
   following 70-533, 70-533, 70-534, 70-473 or 70-475, and will allow you to gain the MCSA and 
   work towards the MCSE: Cloud Platform and Infrastructure.

## Prep Materials
   Prep materials on the Microsoft vitural academy is not very helpful but if you use Azure   
   everyday it shouldn't be a problem, there is plenty of books on azure but they are outdated.
   However the skillpipe book 20532C in this class is up to date and does give you enough info to help 
   you pass the exam   

## Value of passing
   It is a stepping stone for most MCSE paths that work with cloud and gives you the basic understanding 
   of how most cloud infanstructors work, which is very helpful when learning about other cloud platforms
   Having the MCSE will be beneficial for jobs with more responibilty but for everyday use I can't see one
   Alot of the exams for cloud platform cover the same stuff.

## Interaction with Cloud Application Development
   It is the glue as far as the cloud protion of cloud application development goes, 
   studying for it will teach you how to host your services in Azure and the cloud.
