# Developing Microsoft Azure Solutions 70-532
   --Jason Adams
## Skills On Exam
   The skills covered are create and manage Azure Resource Manager Virtual Machines,   
   Design and implement a storage and data strategy,   
   Manage identity, applications, and network services,   
   and Design and implement Azure PaaS compute and web and mobile services.   

## Cert Path
   The certification path is for the MCSA: Cloud Platform and passing this MTA with one other
   will allow you to gain the MCSA and works towards the MCSE: Cloud Platform and Infrastructure.

## Prep Materials
   Prep materials on the Microsoft vitural academy is not very helpful but if you use Azure   
   everyday it shouldn't be a problem, there is plenty of books on azure but they are outdated.   

## Value of passing
   Having the MCSE will be beneficial for jobs with more responibilty but for everyday use I can't see one
   Alot of the exams for cloud platform cover the same stuff.

## Interaction with Cloud Application Development
   The exam itself doesn't really go with the path for developers but the skills are needed.
